# AI SDR Kit: the open-source AI SDR harness

**Give your AI agent a full outbound playbook for LinkedIn and email.** Works with OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, a Grok bot, Claude Code, Codex and any agent that speaks MCP. Your agent writes with its own model. [Zevari](https://zevari.ai/?utm_source=github-kit) does the sending.

MIT licensed. Free to fork.

## What is the AI SDR Kit?

It's the harness that turns a persistent AI agent into an AI SDR (sales development rep). It ships two things:

| Skill | What your agent gets |
|---|---|
| [`agentify-outbound`](skills/agentify-outbound/SKILL.md) | The **Agentify Outbound SOP**: standing orders, a trust ladder and eight phases, from connecting Zevari to running on autopilot. |
| [`outbound-sequence-playbook`](skills/outbound-sequence-playbook/SKILL.md) | The **Outbound Sequence Playbook**: every LinkedIn and email sequence step by step, how to route each lead by ICP score and LinkedIn activity, and the exact campaign program to build it in Zevari. |

Plus an MCP config that connects your agent to Zevari at `https://mcp.zevari.ai/mcp`.

## Which agents does it work with?

| Agent | How to install |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add zevari-ai/ai-sdr-kit`, then `/plugin install ai-sdr-kit@ai-sdr-kit` |
| Codex | `codex plugin marketplace add zevari-ai/ai-sdr-kit`, then `codex plugin install ai-sdr-kit@ai-sdr-kit` |
| OpenClaw | [Connect OpenClaw to Zevari](https://docs.zevari.ai/api/connect/openclaw?utm_source=github-kit), then give it [the SOP](https://zevari.ai/guides/agentify-outbound-sop.md) |
| Hermes Agent | [Connect Hermes to Zevari](https://docs.zevari.ai/api/connect/hermes-agent?utm_source=github-kit), then give it [the SOP](https://zevari.ai/guides/agentify-outbound-sop.md) |
| Grok bot or any other agent | [Bring your own agent](https://docs.zevari.ai/api/connect/bring-your-own-agent?utm_source=github-kit) with a Zevari access token, then give it [the SOP](https://zevari.ai/guides/agentify-outbound-sop.md) |

An agent that is already connected to Zevari doesn't need the files at all. It loads both guides itself with `skills_get` (slugs `agentify-outbound` and `outbound-sequence-playbook`).

## How do I start?

Install the kit, then paste this into your agent:

```
This is my outbound operating procedure. Save it as OUTBOUND-SOP.md and keep one copy.
Read it. Follow the standing orders from now on. Do not send, connect, message, comment,
like, enroll or change any setting until I approve it. Searching and reading are allowed.
Start with Phase 1. Tell me what you need from me, one step at a time.
```

Your agent walks you through each phase one step at a time and asks before it does anything.

## What's free and what's paid?

| Free (this kit) | Paid (Zevari) |
|---|---|
| The SOP, the sequence playbook and the plugin, MIT licensed | Sending on LinkedIn: connection requests, messages, InMail, likes, comments |
| Your agent's own model for research, scoring and writing | Email steps in Zevari campaigns |
| Forking and changing any of it | Safety limits, approvals, warm-up and the web dashboard |

There is no free LinkedIn connection. See [Zevari pricing](https://zevari.ai/pricing?utm_source=github-kit).

## What does my agent do after I install it?

It follows the SOP's eight phases:

1. **Connect:** connect Zevari, confirm your workspace and LinkedIn sender, change nothing.
2. **Business brain:** learn your business and offer from your own materials.
3. **Voice:** learn how you write from your real messages.
4. **ICP, list and scoring:** find your real buyer, build a list, train its scoring with you in batches of 25.
5. **Design the campaigns:** route each lead to a sequence from the playbook and draft the copy for your approval.
6. **Feedback loop:** learn from every correction, with a daily brief before you start work.
7. **Go live on approval:** start slow, inside the caps you approved.
8. **Graduate to autopilot:** only after you've approved its work unchanged for about a week.

Every job (sourcing, scoring, connection requests, DMs, cold email, replies) climbs its own trust ladder: off, read, draft, approve the batch, autopilot.

## How does it pick a sequence for each lead?

By ICP score and LinkedIn activity in the last 30 days:

| ICP score | Active on LinkedIn | Quiet on LinkedIn |
|---|---|---|
| 5 (Strong fit) | Every channel, 1 to 2 new a day | InMail and email |
| 4 (Strong fit) | LinkedIn-led sequence | Email-led sequence |
| 3 (Moderate fit) | Fit check by email | Fit check by email |
| 1 to 2 (Weak fit) | No contact | No contact |

The [playbook](skills/outbound-sequence-playbook/SKILL.md) has every sequence step by step.

## Can my agent write in a famous voice?

Yes. Install the Voice DNA skills (including Alex Hormozi, Josh Braun, Justin Welsh, Chris Walker and April Dunford; inspired by their public work, not affiliated with any of them):

- Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add jpeslar1/john-peslar-ai-skills`, then `/plugin install voice-dna@john-peslar-ai-skills`
- Codex: `codex plugin marketplace add jpeslar1/john-peslar-ai-skills`, then `codex plugin install voice-dna@john-peslar-ai-skills`

Inside Zevari, your agent can also list voices with `skills_list` and apply one to a campaign.

## Is it safe for my LinkedIn account?

Nothing sends until you approve it. The SOP's first standing order is that your agent does nothing but read, search, score and draft until you say yes. Zevari runs all sending inside its [safety limits](https://zevari.ai/safety?utm_source=github-kit).
